I’m Abdul Tayab, a passionate Software Engineering student at Iqra University, Karachi, with a strong focus on Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Full-Stack Development.

Inspired by technology’s power to solve real-world problems, I developed AutoApplyPro, an AI-driven job-seeking platform that automates job searching and application processes. Beyond this, I’ve worked on projects in operating systems, blockchain, and process management, showcasing both my technical depth and ability to explain complex concepts simply.

I bring expertise in Java, Python, React, and ML pipelines, along with hands-on experience in system design, database management, and scalable application development. My goal is to innovate solutions that bridge the gap between automation and human efficiency.

Alongside technical growth, I’m actively exploring research collaborations and preparing publications to contribute to global discussions in AI and emerging technologies.
